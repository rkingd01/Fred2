              Being so protective of the state and system Russian leaders tend not to criticise policy or other leaders but Stalin causes unease.

             <p>Stalin's successor Nikita Khrushchev offered this insight:</p> 

             <br><br>
              <blockquote>
                Stalin was a very distrustful man, sickly suspicious. We know this from our work with him. He could look at
                a man and say: “Why are your eyes so shifty today?” or “Why are you turning so much today and avoiding to
                look me directly in the eyes?” The sickly suspicion created in him a general distrust even toward eminent
                Party workers whom he had known for years. Everywhere and in everything he saw 'enemies,' 'two-facers' and
                'spies.' Possessing unlimited power, he indulged in great willfulness and stifled people morally as well as
                physically. A situation was created where one could not express one’s own volition."

           <p>  Stalin's rule brought about at best unease amongst leading figures in the military, in politics and amongst the intelligensia. At worse he ordered their death on nothing more than a whim.  Many sources refer to the atrocities committed including the following: <br><br>
