        Albert's father-in-law, George Parker, was a member of the Salvation Army which had links with the Red Cross organisation.
          Of the information provided to the Red Cross the address of a former girlfriend yielded a positive outcome. A connection was made and she assisted by contacting Salme and Vassili who she knew lived together in the area. 
    
        An address was provided and by mid-1958 Albert sent the first letter to the home of his father and Salme. Included was the image of himself with Rita and child.

        <h2>The Betrayal of Rosalie</h2> 
        
        
        <p>
        The news of his sister Rosalie upset Albert.  
        She had died of tubercolosis in Aktau, Kazakhstan after travelling there with her two girls to be with her husband only to discover that he was co-habiting with another woman. Her two daughters, Valentina and Nina, were  left unwanted in Kazakhstan. Albert's father, Vassili, made the arduous journey to Aktau, 3000km away, and escorted his grand-daughters safely back to Estonia.

        Salme (16) was only 4 to 6 years older than the girls, nonetheless, she became responsible for them. Albert struggled with the thought that had he been closer he would have gone to fetch the girls. 
        He reasoned that the journey to Kazakhstan must have taken a toll on Vassili.
