      <h3> 'Lost Boys of Estonia'? </h3>
      <p>
     
        After the 2nd World War at least 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Estonia_during_World_War_II">50,000</a>
        Estonians could not safely return home. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        They had fought for Germany against Russia and a victorious Russia came to occupy Estonia again. Any Estonians returning to Estonia-SSR from German ranks faced extreme retribution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In pre-war Estonia Stalinist rule was severe 
        with  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_deportation">10,000</a>
        Estonians deported from 22 May to 20 June 1941.
        On June 22nd 1941 German troops chased the Russian occupiers out of Estonia. Native Estonians were relieved to be rid of Stalin. To keep Russia at bay many Estonians enlisted into bespoke German units designated 'Estonian-SS Legion' and 'Wiking' battalion.

            My father, Albert Georgijev, an Ingrian Russian, joined as soon as he could, such was his hatred of Stalin and all that he represented. 
          He was driven by the loss of the family farm, loss of all that was valued and especially the loss of his mother, a mother of seven.

            At the end of hostilities his unit, 1st Estonian, (20th Waffen Grenadiers), laid down their arms and  were subjected to atrocities referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Hell">'Czech Hell'</a> (May 1945). Albert managed to escape although hundreds of comrades were executed.

                    The story begins with an old photograph taken in Kent, 1946. My father, Albert Georgijev, sits at an open window, a lonely figure, his family beyond reach.  
          
          </p>
          <p>
              Immediately post-war Albert worked on a Kent farm with other ex- <abbr title="Prisoners of War">POWs</abbr> who like him could not be safely repatriated with Stalin still in power.

          As a child I could not comprehend why my father fought in WW2 for the 'other side'.  
         As an adult I am aware of the back-story which is not straightforward, nonetheless, it's important.
