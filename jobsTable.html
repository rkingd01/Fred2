          <h2>Notes on Work      </h2>
          <br>
          <p> 
           Albert was singled out as a fine worker, an asset to the company, as letters of commendation testify in different places of employment. He stayed with British Steel for the longest period and at the age of 47 the company paid for him to attend an advanced course on welding. This qualification allowed management of British Steel's East Moors to place him in a supervisory role. Here Albert was acknowledged as highly competent in the physical and technical demands of the post but was so anxious about the written aspect that he engaged his wife Rita to double check his written accounts. He worked all the hours permitted and within a few years had saved enough to purchase a house. Visitors to the Coke Ovens likened the place to Dante's Inferno. Albert thrived in this environment and was the first foreign British Steel employee to be promoted to supervisor level.

            The co-author of these pages observed him working at Hamilton's Foundry tipping molten metal from the furnace into a large ladle which he then guided to mouldings and filled to the brim spilling not a drop. The metallurgist commented that the ingots were excellent with very little waste.

            Albert always took his work seriously and had little time for co-workers who sought to cut corners and do as little as possible. At 65 and working in Lucas Wiring he asked a fellow worker to lower the volume of his radio as he needed to hear audio feedback from his lathe work. Albert was ignored twice. He then proceeded to demonstrate how a radio could be reduced to many pieces with a single blow from a 5kg lump hammer. The radio owner was somewhat displeased but the rest of the workforce were bent double laughing. Albert's work area was always a lot quieter after that.
