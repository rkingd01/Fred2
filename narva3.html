    <main>  <h1> Narva</h1>

                <p> On reaching the border the family was physically and mentally exhausted but Aliide was beyond exhaustion. The children were infested with lice and covered in sores. They were deloused, clothed and fed, then quarantined. Aliide was confined to a sick bed, unable to leave. </p>
                <p> After four weeks of struggling she died. Listed cause of death: 'typhus fever'. Her children were traumatised and had to quickly come to terms with a life without their mother. Aliide had got them through the darkest days of homelessness, hunger and danger. Because of her they had reached safety.</p>
                <p>As far as the 17 year old Albert was concerned, the real cause of death was 'Stalin'. Indeed,  Joseph Stalin was generally demonised by those of a Finnic culture.

                    <p>
                    Albert and his father, Vassili, had the task of digging a grave for Aliide. They could not lower the coffin as it was raining heavily and water kept flooding the grave. Stones had to be used to weigh the coffin down. </p> <br>
                <p>Confused, and bereaved the younger children were comforted by their older siblings and by relatives they'd never met. In these dark days Albert remembered the kindness of strangers. </p>
            
                <p>As for Vassili, the dispossession of all that was held closest was now total. </p>

                 <h3> Employment in Estonia</h3>
                  <p>
                As the family were settling into Narva Albert and Vassili found employment 
                with the railway company while the oldest sisters, Roosi and Meeta, went to work on a farm. 
                Because of conscription there was a shortage of labour.   
                At 18 Albert left the railway work and went south to Jarva County to work on a large farm. 
                The farmer and his wife became very fond of Albert and treated him well. He received much needed attention and it is believed that their affection helped him deal with the 
                trauma of the past year. Albert proudly recalled that they wanted him to stay as an adopted son.
                 </p>
                <p>   Albert though was driven to join the Estonian Legion as soon as he could.

                 <h3>1943: Madis, Maarja and Aleks Noole arrive in Narva</h3>
        
                <p> Aliide's parents and brother were quarantined on reaching Narva and to their horror soon discovered that Aliide had died. Aleksandr went to his wife's parents' home in Pärnu where he was reunited with his wife, Maria (nee Seiler), and daughter Edith. They spoke German and openly favoured their occupation given that it relieved them of the yoke of imposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism">Stalinism.</a>
