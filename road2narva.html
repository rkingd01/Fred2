    <h1>Escape from Stalin</h1>

<br><br>
        <p>

        It is believed that Vassili had intended going to Leningrad because he had contacts there. </p><br>
        <p>
        Having learned that the city was under 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad">siege </a> Aliide had urged him to head west toward Estonia. This was not an easy decision to make as Vassili being an ex-Red Army soldier with Russian papers was apprehensive about crossing German and Russian lines. </p>
        <p>For safety Vassili guided the family, (two adults and seven children) back into the woods to the same hide-out nestled into the embankment.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>
        After several days and nights the sound of heavy shelling ceased. Early next morning Aliide noticed soldiers atop the embankment and alerted her family. Aliide brought the children out into the open so they could be seen. It was an eerie experience and the image of that dawn silhouette stayed with Albert. Fearing repurcussions after defying orders to leave the area Aliide was relieved to find that they were not Russian soldiers but German. </p>
        <br>
        <p>These were native Estonians in German uniform. Albert remembers his mother conversing with them and offering tea. His  mother's demeanour lifted; her prayers for help had been answered. </p>
             <p> The lead officer explained how they could get authorisation for travel. Following his instructions they acquired a travel permit to get them through German checkpoints on the road to Narva.
              </p> <p> <br>
              At the outset they stopped at a few villages in order to get supplies but they were deserted except for those who could not travel. In one such village they stayed overnight in a deserted manor house rumoured to have some connection to the Romanovs. Shelter in this grand house must have been a strange contrast to sleeping under canvas deep in the woods.</p>    
          <br>  
        <p> In the cold March evenings the family huddled close together to keep warm staying close to the road. Occasionally they were disturbed by German patrols checking papers which Aliide presented because she could converse.  </p>
     
        <p> The family entered German-occupied Estonia at the border town of Narva on Wednesday, March 25th 1942. They were weak from exhaustion and hunger. Aliide had promised her children that she would get them to Estonia and had encouraged them daily.  Having got her family to Narva she collapsed.
